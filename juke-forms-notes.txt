--- Forms --- 

ng-model directive lets you say, "this form input is connected to some variable in the scope" --> this is called data binding 
	angular has 2 way data binding - the data on the page is bound to the models on the scope and vice versa 

- every input tag (form tags) is bound to an ngModelController so you can add a bunch of built-in validation directives such as...
	ng-required
	ng-minlength
	ng-maxlength
	ng-pattern (must pass regex test)
	type="email/number/url"

- <forms> are also bound to ngModelController instances 

$error under the form or input controller will give us access to the errors 
	--> it is by default an empty object
